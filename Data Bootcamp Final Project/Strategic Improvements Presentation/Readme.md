# Strategic Recommendations, Data-Driven Insights, KPIs, and Implementation Plan

## 1. Strategic Recommendations

### a) Focus on Reducing Fraud and Improving Detection
- **Action**: Given the high fraud detection rate, investing in advanced fraud prevention systems and algorithms will help further improve fraud detection. For instance, implementing more sophisticated machine learning models could help reduce false positives in non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Rationale**: With a significant number of fraud-related issues identified across categories, reducing fraud through improved predictive models can enhance profitability and customer trust.

### b) Segment-Specific Marketing Strategies
- **Action**: Tailor marketing campaigns based on customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office). For example, for the Home Office segment, leverage discounts and promotions during the months following the year-end to counteract the seasonality in demand.
- **Rationale**: The fluctuation in sales across segments highlights the need for personalized offers to maintain consistent growth, especially in segments like Home Office, which face higher seasonal variability.

### c) Pricing Strategy Optimization
- **Action**: Monitor and adjust product pricing for categories that show large fluctuations, such as in October 2017 for the Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments. Offering targeted promotions or discounts during off-peak months can balance out the fluctuations.
- **Rationale**: Large price spikes in certain months suggest the opportunity for strategic promotions, reducing customer churn during slow months and boosting sales during peak periods.

### d) Enhance Customer Retention in Low-Volume Segments
- **Action**: For the Home Office segment, where customer count and sales are generally lower, increase efforts to foster customer loyalty through tailored retention programs, loyalty points, and exclusive offers to reduce churn.
- **Rationale**: As customer counts are low in certain segments, focusing on customer retention would yield a higher return than acquisition efforts in these segments.

## 2. Data-Driven Insights

### a) Fraud Detection and Prevention
- The **Logistic Regression** model shows strong performance in detecting fraud, but **false positives** in non-fraud cases (Class 0) need to be addressed. This could be done by further tuning the model for better precision.
- The **Neural Network model** has achieved **perfect performance**, but the remaining concern suggests the model might not generalize well to unseen data. Regularization techniques or more diverse training data could improve its robustness.

### b) Segment-Specific Performance
- **Consumer Segment**: The total sales have shown consistent growth with occasional peaks. However, there’s a notable dip in February 2017, which could be a result of post-holiday seasonal patterns.
- **Corporate Segment**: Sales have been somewhat stable, with peaks showing up in September and drops in the following months. This could be indicative of budget cycles within corporate customers.
- **Home Office Segment**: This segment experiences significant fluctuations, especially with sharp declines in November and December 2017. A deeper look into the specific needs or products in these months could help adjust strategy.
- **Product Pricing**: Fluctuations in product pricing for all segments show that different pricing strategies can yield substantial differences in sales. Analyzing the specific causes of these price fluctuations can help set more predictable pricing models.
- **Outliers**: October 2017 shows significant outliers across segments, particularly with high sales and prices. Understanding the specific events (e.g., promotions, bulk purchases) could aid in replicating this success in the future.

## 3. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

### a) Fraud Detection KPIs
- **Fraud Detection Accuracy**: Measure the proportion of fraud cases correctly detected. **Target**: >98% detection accuracy.
- **False Positive Rate**: Track the number of legitimate non-fraud transactions mistakenly flagged as fraud. **Target**: <2% false positives.
- **Precision and Recall for Fraud Detection**: Improve precision and recall for both non-fraud (Class 0) and fraud (Class 1) categories. **Target**: Precision > 95% and Recall > 90%.

### b) Sales and Customer Engagement KPIs
- **Customer Segmentation Sales Growth**: Measure the sales growth rate in each segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office). **Target**: 10% growth year-over-year in each segment.
- **Customer Retention Rate**: Monitor the percentage of repeat customers. **Target**: Retention rate of 80%+ for the Corporate and Consumer segments.
- **Sales per Customer**: Track how much the average customer spends per transaction. **Target**: Increase sales per customer by 15% year-over-year.

### c) Product Pricing and Marketing KPIs
- **Price Optimization Impact**: Evaluate the effectiveness of pricing adjustments, particularly for high-spike months like October. **Target**: A 10% increase in average monthly revenue from pricing optimization efforts.
- **Promotional Conversion Rate**: Track the effectiveness of promotions in reducing seasonal dips in sales. **Target**: A 20% increase in sales during slow months (November and December) through targeted promotions.
