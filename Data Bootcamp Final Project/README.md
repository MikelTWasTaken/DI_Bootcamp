# Introduction

This analysis of supply chain data explores cohort insights, product delivery times, late delivery risk rates, and potential fraudulent orders. By forecasting demand and identifying bad actors, we aim to align supply chain strategies with business goals and propose strategic improvements.

# Installation

To set up and execute the project, follow these steps:

## Data Collection and Integration
- Gather relevant data from internal systems such as ERP, warehouse management, and transportation systems.
- Ensure all data sources are properly integrated to create a complete dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.
- Standardize and transform data, including dates, product names, and categories.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform descriptive statistics to analyze key metrics such as mean, median, and mode.
- Identify patterns, trends in inventory levels, demand fluctuations, and supplier performance.

## Problem Definition and Goal Setting
- Define specific objectives like reducing inventory costs, improving delivery times, or enhancing supplier relationships.
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for measurement.

## Modeling and Analysis
- Conduct risk analysis to identify potential risks in the supply chain and suggest mitigation strategies.
- Implement demand forecasting using statistical models such as ARIMA and regression.
- Develop optimization models for inventory management and transportation cost minimization.

## Dashboard Creation and Visualization
- Design intuitive and interactive dashboards using Tableau to visualize key metrics, trends, and insights.
- Share dashboards with stakeholders to ensure they provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## Recommendations and Strategic Improvements
- Analyze the results from the data analysis to propose actionable recommendations.
- Suggest improvements to supplier relationships, production processes, or inventory management to align with business goals.
